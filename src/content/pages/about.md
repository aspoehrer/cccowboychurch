  ## Statement of Faith
  
  We believe in the Bible as the inspired Word of God. We believe in one God who exists in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died on the cross for our sins and rose again on the third day.
  
  We believe in salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone. We believe in the power of prayer and the work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers.
