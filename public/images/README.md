- **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text when using images in pages

## How to Add Images

1. Place image files in this directory (`/public/images/`)
2. Reference them in your pages using `/images/filename.jpg`
3. For gallery images, place them in `/public/gallery/`

## Current Status

All images listed above are placeholders and need to be added. The site is fully functional without them, but adding these images will complete the visual design.

## Notes

- Some pages may show placeholder icons (📷) where images should be
- Event images are referenced in `src/content/events/events.yaml`
- Once images are added, update the image paths in the respective files
